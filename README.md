# Rock-Paper-Scissors

The system will ask you to chose a number which will represent your choice (1 - Rock, 2 - Paper, 3 - Scissors). The Computer will randomly chose a number. Both Numbers are taken into account to see who will win. After the winner is declared, the system will ask if you want to play again. You have the option to type 'Y' or 'N' which will terminate or continue the game respectfully.
